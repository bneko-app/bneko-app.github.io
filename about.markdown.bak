Hi, my name is Luca, and I am a developer.

I have decided to start a blog, despite not being into these stuff, because of this thread on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/JackRhysider/status/1524416387434762241](https://twitter.com/JackRhysider/status/1524416387434762241).

I will treat this site as a notepad for ideas, projects, solutions and advices, which I think worth sharing.
Maybe, someone will find this stuff useful, one day or another.
